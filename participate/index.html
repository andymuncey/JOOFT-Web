    <h1>Research participation</h1>

    <h2>TL;DR;</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You have experience teaching programming, and are familiar with Java and are happy to participate in some research which will take around 30 minutes of your time (<a href="PIF.pdf"></a>participant information here</lia></li>
        <li>Try out <a href="../LibraryBook.html">this tutorial</a> for learning object-oriented aspects of Java, making some deliberate coding errors in the process</a></li>
        <li>Provide <a href="https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/GKickjNQg1">feedback here</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About the research</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm Andrew, a PhD student and lecturer at University of Chester, and have developed a tool named <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689535.3689555">JOOFT</a> to assist with the provision of automated feedback to students learning Java, in particular, aspects related to designing objects.</p><p>

JOOFT has recently been integrated into a web-based tutorial, where students can write Java code following a tutorial and test it as they go. The project allows students to run tests to check their code at various stages and gives feedback on erroneous code. The task is designed to introduce concepts of object-orientation through the design a simple class.
 </p><p>
The tool is open source and, having trialled the tool in the context of a lab task with students at my own institution, I'm looking invite other tutors who teach Java to review the task and tool.
</p><p>
Tutors are welcome to use the tool in their own teaching also, if they wish.
</p><p>
The <a href="../LibraryBook.html">tutorial can be found here</a> Once you have had opportunity to read the <a href="PIF.pdf"></a>participant information sheet, I'd be most grateful if you could review the tutorial, ideally by completing the tasks and making deliberate errors, such that you might anticipate a student might make.
</p><p>
Once evaluated, you are asked to complete <a href="https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/GKickjNQg1">this short survey</a>.
</p><p>
You can also choose to provide contact details to participate in a follow up interview, if you think you may include the task within your own teaching.
