  <h1>JOOFT online</h1>
<p>JOOFT is the Java Objecty-Oriented Feedback Tool. It's designed to provide automated feedback on the object oriented Java programming code. You can read more about it in the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689535.3689555">Meaningful automated feedback on Objected-Oriented program development tasks in Java</a></p>

<p>JOOFT online integrates the tool into a web based enviroment whereby students can write code and run associated tests, all from within the browser</p>

<p>At present there is one example tutorial, the <a href=LibraryBook.html> development of a class to represent a Library Book</a></p>


<h2 id="dataUsage">Data usage</h2>
<p>JOOFT online captures the code that's written when you attempt to run a test, along with the test and the result, or the compilation error. It sets a cookie to identify attempts made from the same browser. It doesn't collect any other data. You can turn off this feature, and the associated cookie by clicking Opt-out on the tutorial page. </p>

  
  <h2>Credits</h2>
  <p>Jooft uses the <a href="https://cheerpj.com/">CheerpJ</a> library to allow you to run the Java code in your web browser.</p>
